# Warehouse Management System

## Overview
The Warehouse Management System (WMS) is designed to help users efficiently manage all items and goods stored across one or multiple warehouse locations. The system allows users to categorize inventory, optimize storage space, and streamline tracking of incoming and outgoing goods.

The **potential users** are businesses and individuals looking to improve operational efficiency, reduce inventory errors, and save time managing their stock.

In a typical warehouse setting, there are often multiple storage zones used to organize various types of inventory — including raw materials, finished products, and seasonal goods. These items can differ by size, handling requirements, or usage patterns. Without a proper system, items may be misplaced, stored inefficiently, or retrieved incorrectly. For instance, fast-moving goods might be stored in inaccessible areas, or perishable items could be mixed with long-term inventory. If these issues persist, they can lead to delays, lost items, or even financial loss. 

This challenge inspired me to build a system that helps users manage their warehouses more effectively — enabling them to track inventory accurately, assign logical storage locations, and access needed items quickly and efficiently.
